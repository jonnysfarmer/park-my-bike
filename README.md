# Park My Bike

## Overview

My secound project was a React web app giving you all surrounding bike park locations around a London postcode, with an additional feature of cycling directions from a 2nd postcode.

This was the secound project from General Assembely Software Engineering Immersive, and was a 48 hour paired programming project.
